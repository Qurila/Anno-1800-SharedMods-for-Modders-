  "Description": {
    "English": "shared_OncePerSession: For Modders: Adds an FeatureUnlock that unlocks everytime a variable session is entered the first time. You can use it eg. instead of SessionEnter to reapply global Buffs to a new session. Unfortunately for now it will be repeated whenever the user loads a savegame (then it fires again for all sessions once), but this is still much better than on every single SessionEnter. Use it eg. for ActionBuff/AddBuff."
