  "Description": {
    "Chinese": "For Modders: Condition to check if processing player is an AI or specific AI. The code uses the AI-specific lighthouse as main condition, but it will also make sure no human players are hit by this, even if they somehow controll such a lighthouse (and it will remove the lighthouse for humans, because this also messes with vanilla code)!",

    "German": "Für Modder: Condition um zu prüfen ob der processing Spieler eine KI bzw. eine bestimmte KI ist oder nicht. Der Code nutzt den KI-spezifischen Leuchtturm als Bedingung, aber stellt gleichzeitg sicher, dass keine menschlichen Spieler getroffen werden, selbst wenn sie so einen Leuchtturm besitzen (und es entfernt den Leuchtturm für menschliche Spieler, da dies sonst auch Probleme mit vanilla content bereitet)!",
