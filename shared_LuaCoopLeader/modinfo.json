  "Description": {
    "English": "shared_LuaCoopLeader: Lua scripts are tricky in Multiplayer/Coop because scripts started with ActionExecuteScript are executed for each local player. So eg. 2 times if you play Coop with 2 humans. For MP with 2 seperate human players you can use my shared mod WhichPlayer to make sure your script is executed for the correct human. This mod here is for Coop. It will trigger a PopPop in Coop games for all local players on each game start and ask if you are the Host or not. The answer will be saved to lua and can then be used within lua scripts to make sure scripts are only executed for the Host."
